      <h2>Adison Gordon</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Utah with a strong passion for web design and development.
        I love to combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to craft intuitive and engaging user experiences. My academic journey has been
        marked by hands-on projects, including a capstone project centered on creating Pet-Pedia, a comprehensive pet care website. I also contributed to
        a hackathon project focused on environmental sustainability, developing a platform that enables users to donate unwanted items within their
        local community. This initiative aimed to enhance community connections while minimizing waste.</p>
      <p>
        As a lifelong advocate for rescue animals, I share my home with several furry friends, all of whom are rescues. This connection to animals inspired the
        creation of Pet-Pedia, a resource designed to educate pet owners and promote the well-being of pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a big interest in flora and fauna, from gardening to caring for exotic pets, music, and exploring various art forms,
        including ceramics, sculpting, and painting. I look forward to a future where I can combine my love for coding, creativity, and advocacy to make a meaningful impact.

      <h2>Emily Reynolds</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior at the University of Utah, set to graduate in Fall 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My academic and professional experiences are rooted
        in software engineering, with a primary focus on backend development and additional expertise in frontend technologies. Currently, I am a Software Engineering Intern at
        Snap One, a leader in smart-living solutions, where I contribute to developing innovative systems that empower users to customize their smart-living experiences.
        My project portfolio showcases diverse achievements, including a capstone project designed to assist pet owners and prospective adopters by providing comprehensive resources
        for making informed decisions about pet care. Additionally, I participated in a hackathon project aimed at fostering environmental sustainability by creating a platform for
        users to donate unwanted items locally, promoting community well-being while reducing waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my technical endeavors, I am passionate about lifelong learning and creativity. I enjoy exploring topics in American history, reading fantasy novels, attending live performances,
        and spending quality time with friends and family.
