                <p class="card-text" >Ruff Haven Crisis Sheltering was founded in 2020 by a group of four animal-loving
                    friends who met while volunteering at various animal welfare organizations in Salt Lake County.
                    After working with many people experiencing homelessness and other vulnerable populations they saw a
                    tremendous need for temporary crisis sheltering services in the community. They believe the future of
                    animal welfare will strongly focus on pet retention and keeping pets with their people whenever
                    possible. The co-founders recruited several other passionate people involved in both animal and human
                    welfare organizations to join their Board of Directors. Ruff Haven Crisis Sheltering understands
                    animal welfare is not only about serving pets but also about serving people. We believe animal welfare
                    IS human welfare. </p>
